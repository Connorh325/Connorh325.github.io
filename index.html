                    <p class="bio_text">Born and raised in Darfield, a small rural town 30 minutes west of Christchurch I found myself in Wellington looking to improve myself and meet new people. <br/> I'm a student at Wellington Massey University, majoring in Spatial Design. <br/>
                    After completing my Bachelor at Massey I want to follow it up with another degree, this time Majoring in either Computer Science or Electrical Engineering. <br/>
                    I'm doing a Design Major as I believe that it's something that is important to the modern man, as it's the present method of communication plus it's not something that can be replicated by ai so it's a skill that will remain important for a long time. I also like how design has become such a predominant part of modern society as a way of expression and communication. <br/>
                    I want to follow up with the computer science degree as it too is becoming more and more important in the modern day society, with the increasing human reliance of technology I want to be at the front of the rapidly improving and dynamic world of Technology.
